First Individual ML project

There is given my first individual machine learning project as an university assignment. The dataset is generated following a pdf of a function that is very close to normal distribution. Before employment of classification algorithms, I did exploratory data analysis and unsupervised learning. As I was given which algorithms to use and compare, I employed Random forest and k-NearestNeigbors classification algorithms.
